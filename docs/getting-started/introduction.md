# Qandle: AI-Optimized Technical Indicators API

**:material-lightning-bolt: Qandle delivers pre-computed, AI-ready technical indicators in a single API call.**

Building AI applications for financial markets is challenging: technical indicators require complex math, data is scattered across expensive APIs, and raw market data isn't optimized for AI reasoning.

Qandle AI provides deterministic, pre-calculated technical indicators delivered in one API call, formatted for maximum token efficiency and AI comprehension.

No complex calculations, no scattered data sources—just clean financial intelligence formatted specifically for AI applications and LLMs.
