# Integrate Qandle AI with **langchain** and **langraph**

!!! tip "Agentic Support"
    **LangChain** is a framework for building applications with large language models, providing tools for chaining prompts, managing conversations, and integrating external data sources. **LangGraph** extends this by offering stateful, multi-actor applications with graph-based workflows for complex AI agents.

Qandle AI integrates seamlessly with **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to build intelligent financial agents. Leverage pre-computed financial intelligence instead of having LLMs calculate metrics in real-time.
